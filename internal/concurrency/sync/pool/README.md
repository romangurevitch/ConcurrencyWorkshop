## Introduction to Pool

The `sync.Pool` type allows for the reuse of objects, which can help to save allocations and reduce GC pressure, especially in performance-critical applications.

## Usage of Pool

```go
var pool = &sync.Pool{
    New: func() interface{} {
        return new(bytes.Buffer)
    },
}

func main() {
    buf := pool.Get().(*bytes.Buffer)
    // Use buf...
    pool.Put(buf)
}
```

## Use Cases

- **Buffer Pooling**: Reusing byte buffers for encoding/decoding operations, or to accumulate data before writing it to disk or sending over the network.
- **Object Pooling**: In scenarios with high allocation rates, reusing objects can significantly improve performance and reduce GC pressure.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Persistence Misconception**: Objects in a sync.Pool do not persist across garbage collection cycles. If not re-used quickly, pooled objects may be collected, leading to a lack of understanding regarding the pool's behavior.
- **Complex Object Lifecycles**: sync.Pool works best with simple object lifecycles. Complex lifecycles can lead to bugs or unexpected behavior.

## Best Practices

- **Simplicity**: Keep pooled object lifecycles simple.
- **Clear Objects**: Clear any state from objects before returning them to the pool.
