execute.

## Introduction to Gosched

`runtime.Gosched` hints the scheduler to pause the current goroutine and give other goroutines a chance to run.

## Usage of Gosched

```go
runtime.Gosched()
```

## Use Cases

- Improving concurrency in CPU-bound programs.
- Preventing long-running goroutines from starving others.

## Common Pitfalls

- Overuse can lead to performance degradation.
- Not a substitute for proper goroutine synchronization.

## Best Practices

- Use sparingly and understand the implications on your program's concurrency.
